This file will contain the names of the variables that everyone might require during the development process.
The express session module was used to create sessions and as such variables can be accessed by accessing the variable req.session.
Print the req.session object to better understand the contents within it.
For now the req.session object contains a key userData.
req.session.userData will give access to all the data of the user right after logging in.
