# <h1 align="center">UniVerse</h1>
<strong>"UniVerse"</strong> is a web-based social networking platform designed specifically for university students to connect, collaborate, and share academic and social resources in one integrated space. The platform aims to enhance campus communication and peer engagement by providing features such as discussion forums, post reactions and comments, friend connections, private messaging, and an academic resource hub where students can access and share study materials.

Additionally, an event section enables users to stay updated about upcoming university events, club activities, and workshops. By merging social interaction with academic collaboration, "UniVerse" fosters a supportive and interactive digital environment that strengthens student communities within the university.

Developed using the <strong>MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)</strong>, the system ensures a responsive, scalable, and modern architecture that supports real-time communication and efficient data handling.
